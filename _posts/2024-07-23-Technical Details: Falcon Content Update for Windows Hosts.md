## What Happened?

On July 19, 2024, at 04:09 UTC, CrowdStrike released a sensor configuration update for Windows systems as part of ongoing operations. The update is part of the Falcon platform's protection mechanisms. However, this particular update triggered a logic error, causing a system crash and a blue screen (BSOD) on affected systems.

The issue was promptly addressed, with the problematic configuration update being remediated at 05:27 UTC on the same day. This incident was not the result of or related to a cyberattack.

## Impact

Customers using Falcon sensor for Windows version 7.11 and above, and who were online between 04:09 UTC and 05:27 UTC on July 19, may have experienced the system crash.

Systems that downloaded the configuration update during this time window were susceptible to crashes.

## Configuration File Primer

The configuration files, known as “Channel Files,” play a crucial role in the behavioral protection mechanisms of the Falcon sensor. These updates are routine and occur several times daily to counter novel tactics, techniques, and procedures identified by CrowdStrike.

For Windows systems, these Channel Files are located in the directory:

```
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike\
```

The files begin with “C-” and are followed by a unique identifier. The Channel File involved in this event is 291, with filenames starting as “C-00000291-” and ending with a .sys extension.

## Technical Details

Channel File 291 is responsible for monitoring named pipe executions on Windows systems. Named pipes facilitate normal interprocess or intersystem communication within Windows.

The configuration update intended to target new malicious named pipes was released at 04:09 UTC. Unfortunately, it introduced a logic error that led to system crashes.

## Remediation

The logic error in Channel File 291 has been corrected. No further changes to this file will be made beyond the updated logic. The Falcon sensor will continue to monitor and protect against named pipe abuses.

Systems running Linux or macOS are not impacted, as they do not utilize Channel File 291.

## Root Cause Analysis

We are conducting a thorough root cause analysis to understand how this logic flaw occurred. This analysis is ongoing, and we are committed to identifying improvements to strengthen our processes. Updates will be provided as the investigation continues.
