In this post, I will analyze a Python implementation of a Connect 4 agent that uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make optimal moves. The code aims to balance performance and decision quality by evaluating possible future game states.

## Overview

The main function of our agent is `my_agent`, which takes `observation` and `configuration` as inputs. These inputs are standard parameters in the Connect 4 environment provided by the competition platform. The function extracts key configuration variables such as the number of columns, rows, and the number of consecutive marks required to win (`inarow`). Additionally, it extracts the current state of the board and the player's mark.

### Key Utility Functions

#### Valid Move Check

The `is_valid_move(board, column)` function ensures that a move is valid by checking if the selected column is not full.

```python
def is_valid_move(board, column):
    return board[column] == 0
```

#### Making a Move

The `make_move(board, column, mark)` function simulates placing a player's mark in the specified column of the board, creating a new board state.

```python
def make_move(board, column, mark):
    new_board = board[:]
    for row in range(rows-1, -1, -1):
        if new_board[column + (row * columns)] == 0:
            new_board[column + (row * columns)] = mark
            break
    return new_board
```

### Board Evaluation

The agent evaluates the board position using the `evaluate_position(board, mark)` function, which assesses potential wins and favorable configurations of marks for both the player and the opponent.

```python
def evaluate_position(board, mark):
    score = 0
    # Evaluation logic (omitted for brevity)
    return score
```

#### Evaluating Windows

The `evaluate_window(window, mark)` function scores individual windows of cells based on their configuration, adding points for favorable patterns and subtracting points for opponent's advantageous patterns.

```python
def evaluate_window(window, mark):
    opponent_mark = 3 - mark
    score = 0
    # Scoring logic (omitted for brevity)
    return score
```

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

The core of the decision-making process is handled by the `alpha_beta(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player)` function. This function recursively evaluates potential future game states up to a specified depth, using the alpha-beta pruning technique to eliminate branches that cannot improve the outcome.

```python
def alpha_beta(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    if depth == 0:
        return evaluate_position(board, mark)
    # Alpha-beta pruning logic (omitted for brevity)
```

## Main Decision Logic

In the `my_agent` function, we iterate over each possible move, evaluate its potential outcome using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, and select the move that maximizes the player's chances of winning.

```python
def my_agent(observation, configuration):
    best_move = None
    max_eval = MIN_SCORE
    depth = 6  # Adjust depth based on performance and time constraints
    # Main decision-making logic (omitted for brevity)
    return best_move
```

### Printing the Board

For debugging and visualization purposes, the `print_board(board)` function can be used to display the current state of the board.

```python
def print_board(board):
    for r in range(rows):
        row = board[r * columns:(r + 1) * columns]
        print(row)
    print()
```

## Conclusion

This Connect 4 agent leverages the power of alpha-beta pruning to make optimal moves by evaluating future game states and potential outcomes. By balancing depth and computational efficiency, the agent is designed to play Connect 4 effectively against human or AI opponents. This approach demonstrates a common strategy in game-playing AI where lookahead and evaluation functions are crucial for decision-making.
